## Motivation

In an emergency situation where a user feels threatened but had to make a call discretely, traditional large-button cellphones had a feature that would allow users to speed-dial with one click of a pre-set button to call for help. Touch-screen phones, a modern standard, makes dialing by tactile only difficult. `Unspoken Caller` app was created for modern touch-screen smartphones to offer a keyword-sensitive, voice-activated, and discrete dialing feature to users.
